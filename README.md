# Livestock Manager
This project was developed with the purpose of completing the Object-Oriented Programming course in Python, as part of my studies in Big Data in Agribusiness at university.

This project aims to develop a cattle management system. It allows the separation of cattle into cows and bulls, tracking their age, breed, and, for cows, managing their milk production. Additionally, it tracks when each animal was added to the herd.
